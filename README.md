# C-_GENETICS  

## This project has a ton of magic numbers and lots of gnarly ineffective code. Also it has zero to none comments. My bad. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   

Unfortunately, the project was stagnant for a while and I'm not sure when I'll be able to recommence its development.  

## This is a simple realization of genetic algorithm with a visual representation to accompany it.  

Controls:  
  -Space to pause  
  -Right Click to place safezones  
  -Left Click on a cell to display its neural network  
  -1 2 3 4 to change simulations speed  
  -R to clear safezones
